# FishWeather Forecast & Tides

A Node.js tool for fishing forecasts. Combines 7-day wind, wave, and weather data from [FishWeather](https://fishweather.com) with NOAA tide predictions and moon phase calculations. Provide a location and it finds the nearest stations automatically. Available as a CLI, Node.js library, and MCP server for Claude Code.

## Data Captured

**Weather forecast** (per day, AM and PM):

- **Peak Wind Speed** (mph) and **Gust Speed** (mph)
- **Wind Direction** (compass bearing and degrees, where the wind is blowing **from**)
- **Wave Height** (ft)
- **Air Temperature** (°F)
- **Cloud Cover** (%) and **Rain Chance** (%)

**Tides** (per day, from NOAA):

- **High/Low tide times** and **heights** (ft, MLLW datum)
- Sourced from the nearest NOAA tide prediction station

**Moon phase** (per day):

- **Phase name**: New Moon, Waxing Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous, Full Moon, Waning Gibbous, Last Quarter, Waning Crescent
- **Illumination %**: 0% (new) to 100% (full)

## Install from npm

```bash
npm install -g @volare-consulting/fishweather-forecast
npx playwright install chromium
fishweather "southport, nc"
```

Or use via `npx` without installing:

```bash
npx @volare-consulting/fishweather-forecast "key west, fl"
```

## Setup (from source)

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/volare-consulting-software/fishweather.git
cd fishweather
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Usage

```bash
node src/forecast.js <location> [options]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Full fishing forecast (weather + tides + moon)
node src/forecast.js "southport, nc"

# Tides only (no weather scraping — fast)
node src/forecast.js "southport, nc" --tides

# JSON output (useful for piping to other tools)
node src/forecast.js "key west, fl" --json

# Tides as JSON
node src/forecast.js "key west, fl" --tides --json

# Show the browser window while scraping (for debugging)
node src/forecast.js "outer banks" --visible
```

## How It Works

### Weather Forecast

1. Searches `fishweather.com/windlist/<location>` for nearby weather stations
2. Selects the first free station (skips PRO/PLUS stations that require a paid subscription)
3. Navigates to that station's spot page and switches to the 7 Day forecast view
4. Extracts wind speed, gust, direction, wave height, temperature, cloud cover, and rain chance for each AM/PM period
5. Reverses the raw wind direction by 180° so it represents where the wind is blowing **from**

### Tides

1. Geocodes the location to lat/lng using the ArcGIS geocoder (free, no key)
2. Finds the nearest NOAA tide prediction station from the full station list (3,400+ stations)
3. Fetches high/low tide predictions from the NOAA CO-OPS API (free, no key)

### Moon Phase

Calculates moon phase and illumination for each day using an astronomical algorithm based on the synodic month. No external API needed.

### Moon Phase for Fishing

Moon phase is included because it affects fish behavior. Around a **Full Moon**, fish tend to feed more actively at night due to increased visibility. The day after a full moon, you can often wait to head out until later in the morning since the fish were up feeding late.

## Architecture

```
src/
  fishweather.js  — FishWeather scraping (Playwright browser, station search, forecast)
  noaa.js         — NOAA tides (geocode location, find nearest station, fetch predictions)
  moon.js         — Moon phase calculator (pure math, no dependencies)
  lib.js          — Orchestrator (combines weather + tides + moon into one result)
  forecast.js     — CLI entry point (also serves as MCP entry via --mcp flag)
  mcp-server.js   — MCP server definition
```

## MCP Server (Claude Code Integration)

This package runs as an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, exposing tools that Claude Code can call directly.

### Register with Claude Code

**Via npm (recommended):**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio fishweather -- npx @volare-consulting/fishweather-forecast --mcp
```

**Via local source (this repo):**

The project root `.mcp.json` is already configured. After setup, restart Claude Code and the tools will be available automatically.

**Manual `.mcp.json`:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fishweather": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@volare-consulting/fishweather-forecast", "--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

| Tool             | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `get_forecast`   | Full 7-day fishing forecast: wind, waves, weather, tides, and moon phase. Takes a `location` parameter. |
| `get_tides`      | NOAA high/low tide predictions only. Takes a `location` parameter and optional `days` (default 7). Fast — no browser needed. |

### Example Prompts in Claude Code

> "What's the wind forecast for Key West this week?"

> "Should I go fishing in Southport this Saturday?"

> "When is high tide in Wrightsville Beach tomorrow?"

Claude will call the appropriate tool and use the data to give you a complete answer.

## Troubleshooting

- **Forecast table did not load** — The site may be blocking headless browsers. Try running with `--visible` to see what's happening. A `debug-screenshot.png` is saved automatically on failure.
- **No free stations found** — All nearby stations may require a Pro/Plus subscription. Try a different or broader location search.
- **Tide data missing** — If NOAA tide data fails to load, the full forecast still works — tides will be omitted with a warning. Use `--tides` separately to debug.
